## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am most interested in automotive and aerospace fields. At Cornell, I am one of the Chassis leads on Cornell FSAE Racing. We design, manufacture, and compete with a formula-style car each year. My primary responsibility is to oversee and guide the overall mechanical and structural design of this years car.
